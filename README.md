# Contracts
A set of Solidity smart contracts used by IDriss.
## Setup
```
npm install
npx hardhat compile
```

### Mythril
Mythril is a symbolic execution engine. Setup instructions can be found [HERE](https://mythril-classic.readthedocs.io/en/master/installation.html)

### Slither
Slither is a static code analyzer. Setup instructions can be found [HERE](https://github.com/crytic/slither#how-to-install)

## Running tests
```
npx hardhat test
```

## Testing manually with Remix
0. Setup remixd to connect Remix to a local filesystem or copy-paste the contracts mentioned below:
1. Deploy ```src/contracts/mocks/MaticPriceAggregatorV3Mock.sol```
1. Deploy ```src/contracts/mocks/IDrissRegistryMock.sol```
3. Add new hash to address mappings by invoking ```IDrissRegistryMock.addIDriss()```
1. Deploy ```src/contracts/mocks/SendToHashMock.sol``` providing adresses of contracts from step ***1*** and ***2***


## Running code analysis tools
```
npm run slither
npm run mythril
```

## Deployment
In order to automatically deploy smart contracts to EVM node you have to create specific files for each environment:
- **.env.dev** - used for local development. Deploys contract to local ganache node.
- **.env.test** - test node config
- **.env.prod** - mainnet node config

After creating proper config files, you can deploy the contract by using proper command for each environment:
```
npm run deploy-dev
npm run deploy-test
npm run deploy-prod
```
